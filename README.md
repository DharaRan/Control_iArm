# Control_iArm
Biomedical application to machine learning and pattern recognition. 
In this project, my team and I had to control an iArm with EMG signal in our arm. 
So, there were eight arm movement, such as fist or moving the hand up, with different EMG signal. 
Thus, in theory each signal would be cause the iArm to move in a different direction. So moving the 
hand up will make, iArm move up. This project was to mimic how myoelectric prosthesis works.
